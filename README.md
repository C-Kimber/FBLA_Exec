 My experience in creating this game has been incredibly informative, 
 this game has been the most complicated and complete game i have worked on. 
 Considering I have built this game from scratch using only Python and a 
 graphics library Pygame, I have learned a ton about optimizing visuals. 
 I still have much to learn and I look forward to it!
